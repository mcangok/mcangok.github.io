I am a PhD student in Department of Electrical Engineering at Northwestern University advised by Prof. Michael Honig. I am affiliated with the COMNET lab and my research is supported by SpectrumX (a NSF funded Spectrum Innovation Center). My research interests are interference mitigation and management for spectrum coexistence, integrated sensing and communications for wideband systems, and machine learning for next-generation wireless networks. I am also broadly interested in mathematical foundations of data science, computer vision, distributed/convex optimization and high-dimensional statistics.

Prior to Northwestern, I worked in telecom industry for three years and received my BS and MS degrees from Bilkent University in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2019 and 2022, respectively. During my MS, I am supervised by Prof. Orhan Arikan and worked on Semantic Signal Processing techniques. 

I am always eager to forge new connections, exchange ideas, and embark on collaborative research for future wireless technologies, machine learning and AI. Please, do not hesitate to reach out to me via e-mail.
