abstract: Semantic signal processing and communications are poised to play a central part in developing the next generation of sensor devices and networks. A crucial component of a semantic system is the extraction of semantic signals from the raw input signals, which has become increasingly tractable with the recent advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The accurate extraction of semantic signals using the aforementioned ML and AI methods, and the detection of semantic innovation for scheduling transmission and/or storage events are critical tasks for reliable semantic signal processing and communications. In this work, we propose a reliable semantic information extraction framework based on our previous work on semantic signal representations in a hierarchical graph-based structure. The proposed framework includes a time integration method to increase fidelity of ML outputs in a class-aware manner, a graph-edit-distance based metric to detect innovation events at the graph-level and filter out sporadic errors, and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to produce smooth and reliable graph signals. The proposed methods within the framework are demonstrated individually and collectively through simulations and case studies based on real-world computer vision examples.
