	abstract = {Introduction: The limited sensitivity of microbiological testing, challenges in radiological differential diagnosis, and expectations of quick and accurate diagnosis required developing clinical decision support systems (CDSS). We propose a new deep learning-based hybrid CDSS that combines the advantageous aspects of thorax computed tomography(CT) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction(PCR) to overcome the weakness of each one.Methods: We retrospectively constructed a database that contains CT images of healthy subjects and patients with COVID-19 pneumonia(CP), bacterial/viral pneumonia(BVP), interstitial lung diseases(ILD), and PCR data of patients who were tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2. A new 3D-convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) and long short-term memory network(LSTM) based CDSS is developed to perform accurate and robust detection of COVID-19 using CT images and PCR data.Results: Performance results of the proposed models (Fig1) provide highly reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 with 93.2\% and 99.7\% AUC for CT and PCR data, respectively.Conclusion: Proposed CDSS with state-of-the-art deep learning methods provides similar performance compared to both radiologists in CT evaluation and microbiologists in PCR evaluation and can be safely used.~We plan to develop a hybrid CDSS algorithm further, combining laboratory data with CT and PCR models.FootnotesCite this article as Eur Respir J 2022; 60: Suppl. 66, 1357.This article was presented at the 2022 ERS International Congress, in session {\textquotedblleft}-{\textquotedblright}.This is an ERS International Congress abstract.
